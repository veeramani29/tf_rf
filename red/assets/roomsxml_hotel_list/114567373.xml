For untold millions of fans who cherish Elvis, that dream has become a destination. Now a new part of the dream is coming to life - a place that brings you closer to Graceland than ever before. The Guest House at Graceland welcomes you. Located on beautifully landscaped property, just a few steps from the gates of Graceland, this unique accommodation is inspired by the warm hospitality that Elvis always showed his guests. From the southern colonial exterior to the specialty suites (many with design overseen by Priscilla Presley herself), every aspect of The Guest House will reflect Elvis' personal style and the unique character of Graceland.The official opening for The Guest House at Graceland will take place October 27-30, 2016, with a four-day, star-studded Grand Opening Celebration. Opening activities will be highlighted by a Guest House ribbon-cutting ceremony, exclusive live concerts, celebrity appearances and red carpet VIP events throughout the weekend, celebrating Elvis Presley and his legacy, marking the opening of the most significant enhancement to Graceland since it opened to the public in 1982, and the largest hotel project in Memphis in over 90 years.</Text></Description><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
