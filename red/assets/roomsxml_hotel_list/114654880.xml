Pavilions and villas are scattered across tropical vegetation and ponds, perched on rugged stone headlands and rests steps from an endless fine-sand alabaster beach. Located at the edge of the Caribbean Sea on the island of Turks and Caicos in the British West Indies, the resort is a private and exclusive hideaway with a turquoise Atlantic Ocean teaming with spectacular diving opportunities. It provides the perfect opportunity to savour authentic tropical paradise.</Text></Description><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
