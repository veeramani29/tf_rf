Poised between the Atlantic Ocean and palatial Palm Beach mansions, The contemporary exterior harbours a come-hither lobby of rich, dark woods and botanical beauty. Guest rooms and suites are equally exotic, many with private verandas or balconies. Guests at the Tideline Ocean Resort and Spa can experience therapies and fitness classes in the full-service spa, The Babor Spa at the Tideline. A meditation garden is also only steps away.Outside, the ocean beckons like an ever-present friend who lives steps away from you. (Which, of course, it does.) Or slip into a calmer form of H2O at the pool enclave, with its palm trees and private cabanas. Rounding out this archetype of all beach resorts is the state-of-the-art fitness canter and on-site spa retreat.</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>40</Score><Description>Four star</Description></Rating><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
