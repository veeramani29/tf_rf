The castle is not a conventional hotel, but a family home which welcomes guests. The owners are proud to have five gold stars for guest accommodation but hope you won`t go there under any misconception that it offers the same services as a five star hotel. Its stars are for its accommodation and hospitality, not its facilities. It is probably the best B&amp;B in England and also a real family home â€“ it`s essentially a superb B&amp;B with lots of extra bells and whistles! Augill Castle is situated between three national parks, close to the geographical centre of Britain. Augill has 14 traditional, slightly quirky or mildly funky boutique style bedrooms.</Text></Description><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
