Created as a traditional riad, it has been lovingly restored by skilled craftsmen and combines Moorish architecture with lush vegetation and interiors designed to reflect both colonial influences and traditional decoration. There are numerous patios and cosy lounges to be discovered, as well as galleries, carved plaster archways, sculpted wooden doors and courtyard fountains. The 27 charming guestrooms and suites are decorated in traditional Moroccan style and come with all mod cons, including a private bathroom with separate shower and bath tub, air conditioning, satellite TV and free Wi-Fi. There is an outdoor pool with a sun deck where guests can relax, plus a luxury spa with a traditional hammam and a full range of treatments available. Lunch is served around the pool or on the shady terrace, while for dinner guests can enjoy delicious Moroccan and Mediterranean fare in the intimate atmosphere of the hotel`s restaurant. This riad is only 15 minutes from the airport with a free shuttle service for guests.</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>50</Score><Description>Five star</Description></Rating><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
