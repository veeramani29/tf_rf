You'll be a short walk to the harbor, a few blocks from businesses and just steps from restaurants and shopping. Business travelers will appreciate the proximity of our San Diego downtown hotel to Solar Turbines, a Caterpillar Company, Toyota, Titan Corp, San Diego Courthouse and Lockheed Martin. All this and more things to do near San Diego are just steps from the Homewood Suites by Hilton San Diego Downtown/Bayside and Hilton Garden Inn San Diego Downtown/Bayside.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>PropertyInformation</Type><Text>null</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>DiningFacilities</Type><Text>null</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>Short</Type><Text>null</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>30</Score><Description>Three star</Description></Rating><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
