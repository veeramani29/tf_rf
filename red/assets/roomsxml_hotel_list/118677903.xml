Its exceptional location makes it one of the most beautiful places in Argentine Patagonia. Quime Quipan is located at the foot of Mount Otto and the Piedras Blancas ski center, just 10 blocks from the thriving historic downtown. The inn is in a perfect location within the pickup zone for day trips, and public transportation is right at our doorstep. It's also on the way to Mount Catedral, the Circuito Chico and virtually all the other local attractions.

The inn features spacious grounds and ample parking, and has just 15 guest rooms, each with an outsider view, private bathroom, cable TV and phone. The owners and dedicated staff are always available to offer the warm personal attention that will make your stay unforgettable.

Our restaurant, finished in native cypress and stone, looks out on an extensive garden that includes a 300-year-old cypress tree. It's a delightful place to relax and savor exquisite breakfasts with homemade jams made from fruits of the forest as well as the classic Argentine dulce de leche. At dinner, you can choose from delicious dishes prepared by our chef and a carefully selected wine list.</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>30</Score><Description>Three star</Description></Rating><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
